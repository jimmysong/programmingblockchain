      <description>We at Programming Blockchain are committed to making the world better through Bitcoin. The biggest deficit in the Bitcoin ecosystem is the lack of developers that understand the technical details of Bitcoin. This two-day seminar is a way to bridge the gap.
When you take this course, you aren&amp;rsquo;t just getting two days of instruction, you are joining a community of like-minded developers. After the seminar, you will join a community of developers with whom you can collaborate with on various projects to increase your profile.</description>
