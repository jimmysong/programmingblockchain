      <description>We at Programming Blockchain are committed to making the world better through Bitcoin. The biggest deficit in the Bitcoin ecosystem is the lack of developers that understand the technical details of Bitcoin. This two-day seminar is a way to bridge the gap.
When you take this course, you aren&amp;rsquo;t just getting two days of instruction, you are joining a community of like-minded developers. After the seminar, you will join a community of developers with whom you can collaborate with on various projects to increase your profile.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I just finished the Programming Blockchain course with Jimmy Song , in beautiful Santa Monica!
This is THE COURSE to take for a highly technical, hands-on, deep dive into the Bitcoin ecosystem.
It started with the math behind elliptic curve cryptography and then, before we knew it, we were creating transactions by hand, in hexadecimal, then submitting them to the bitcoin testnet. And that was just the warm up act!</description>
