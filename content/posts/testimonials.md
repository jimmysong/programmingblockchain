"I just finished the Programming Blockchain course with Jimmy Song , in beautiful Santa Monica! 

This is THE COURSE to take for a highly technical, hands-on, deep dive into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

It started with the math behind elliptic curve cryptography and then, before we knew it, we were creating transactions by hand, in hexadecimal, then submitting them to the bitcoin testnet. And that was just the warm up act!

Thank you Jimmy for creating this awesome course!" - [Costin Rizan](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6324855226700435456/)

"Just finished a 2 day mind-bendingly intensive Programming Blockchain seminar with Jimmy Song in London.  Starting with Finite Fields & Elliptic Curve Cryptography, right through Transaction Signing and Verification to scripting Smart Contracts.  All hands on coding in Python so that you come out of it really understanding how it work even if your brains are oozing out your ears a little. :)" - [Alan Carbery](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6361990277346975744)
