"I just finished the Programming Blockchain course with Jimmy Song , in beautiful Santa Monica! 

This is THE COURSE to take for a highly technical, hands-on, deep dive into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

It started with the math behind elliptic curve cryptography and then, before we knew it, we were creating transactions by hand, in hexadecimal, then submitting them to the bitcoin testnet. And that was just the warm up act!

Thank you Jimmy for creating this awesome course!" - [Costin Rizan](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6324855226700435456/)
